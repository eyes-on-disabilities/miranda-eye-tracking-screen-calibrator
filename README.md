# Miranda â€“ The Eye Tracking Screen Calibrator

Miranda is a GUI tool for calibrating eye and head tracker input to match your screen gaze. It enables seamless integration with other applications, allowing you to use your calibrated tracker data in various ways.

For example, you can use Opentrack as an input source, calibrate your head rotation to your screen, and output the data as UDP messages. This enables you to control applications like OptiKey with your head movements.
